Hi, I'm Dennis! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a __Frontend Engineer__ at [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org) where I'm building the [future](https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/projects/OpenMRS+3.0%3A+A+Frontend+Framework+that+enables+collaboration+and+better+User+Experience) of open-source electronic medical records systems for the developing world.

I'm interested in designing and building fast, polished interfaces, UX/DX and documentation.

If I'm not working, I'm likely playing football at a pitch somewhere, nerding out or hanging out with friends.
